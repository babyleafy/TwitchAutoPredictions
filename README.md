Toggle the Automate Point Bonus Collection button to enable the extension to collect point bonuses (+50 points)
Toggle the Automate Betting button to enable the extension to make prediction based on the following settings
* Min % Difference: The minimum percent difference between the two sides of the prediction for the extension to automatically bet. The extension will automatically bet on the underdog. 
* Seconds Before Bet Closes: Tells the extension when to place the prediction.
* Percent of Points to Bet: Tells the extension what percent of your current points to use in each prediction.

## Simple Stats
The extension keeps track of just two cummulative numbers for now (I plan to add more statistics tracking in the future).
* Points Collected: Total amount of points collected from Twitch bonuses across all channels
* Predictions Made: Total number of predictions made across all channels
